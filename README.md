# Neovim config

My Neovim config based around the AstroNvim distribution and astrocommunity.

Primarily meant to be used as part of my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/maneren/dotfiles).
The separation was mainly historical, but is still kept for cleaner versioning,
since I change this much more frequently than the other dotfiles.

Everyone is welcome to use this or copy parts of it into their configs as they
please. Just don't expect anything too stable, most plugins are tracking the
main/master branches and the config itself is always work-in-progress.

Compatibility is maintained with the latest Neovim version available in repos of
whatever OS I currently use (nowadays mostly Arch derivatives, so quite
up-to-date).
