# Neovim config

My Neovim config based heavily around AstroNvim and astrocommunity.

Primarily meant to be used as part of my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/maneren/dotfiles).
The separation was mainly historical, but is still kept for cleaner versioning,
since I change this much more frequently than the dotfiles.

Compatibility is maintained with the latest Neovim version available in repos of
whatever OS I currently use (mostly Arch derivatives tho, so quite up-to-date).
